Filabel's documentation
===================================

Filabel is a tool that can be used to label GitHub's pull requests via their `API`__. The labels are added and/or removed based on changed files. 

You can use Filabel through its command-line interface, or by directly importing the classes you need. For more info, please look at :doc:`../usage/index`.

The module's sources can be found at GitHub `repository`__ and the module can also be found at `TestPyPi`__.
